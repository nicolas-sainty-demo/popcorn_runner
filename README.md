# Description
This project is a mid-year project. It's done with CSFML (translation in C of C++ SFML library)\
Create your own Runner game.\

Your game must follow the following rules:
• the player is a character who runs in a map you took as parameter.\
• enemies and obstacles must appear on the opposite side to the player position.\
• the player can use the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles and enemies.\
• as the player runs, a score, which will be displayed, will increase.\
• when the player dies or finishes the map, the score is displayed inside the window.\
The program have to be able to:\
• read a file describing an environnement and use it to render a visual.
• manage basic game physics.
• manage multiple entities at the same time.
